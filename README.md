# Elevate-Labs-Task-4

The objective of the task was to design an interactive dashboard for business stakeholders using a visualization tool such as Power BI/Tableau. My task was completed using Microsoft Power BI. I made use of two Excel datasets which I attached unto this repositiory namely Product.xlsx and SalesData.xlsx. To create this dashboard, I first imported those two datasets into Power BI and transformed them on the Power Query Editor. Amonsgt many transformations, I changed the data types for the Ticket Price and Revenue columns in the SalesData workbook. I also implemented slicers on the Channel and Quarter fields from the SalesData workbook to aid analysis.
